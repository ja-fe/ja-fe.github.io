I am currently in ~~birbta~~ beta! I made this game/study tool to get better at non-visual aspects of bird identification. For example, you might not be able to see or hear the bird entirely clearly, but what if you did the logic of thinking about position, time of year, general size, behaviour etc? Real birders study hard and gain experience, but we will stay inside and play computer games!

Identify the bird in question by spending points to uncover information about its appearance, behaviour, and more!
